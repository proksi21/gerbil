# Installation

## Source Code
The source code for Gerbil is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil),
with the latest release available in [releases](https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil/releases).

For the latest Gerbil, you can clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil.git
```

## Dependencies

The latest Gerbil release (v0.14) requires Gambit v4.9.0;
the latest Gambit is recommended nonetheless (v4.9.1).

The core system has no dependencies outside Gambit, but the standard
library has several mostly optional dependencies. The only hard dependency
is `libcrypto` from OpenSSL; important parts of the standard library
require it.

All the other dependencies are soft.
Most library modules with foreign dependencies are not built by default,
with the exception of `zlib` and `sqlite`. These are ubiquitous, stable
and generally useful enough to warrant being present by default;
you can still disable them if you want for a minimal installation.

In ubuntu, you can install the dependencies for a default installation with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

The optional libraries can be enabled or disabled at build-time
by editing `$GERBIL_HOME/src/std/build-features.ss`.
You can also enable features later, by editing `build-features.ss` and
running `./build.sh stdlib` in `$GERBIL_HOME/src/`.


## Build Instructions
After unpacking a release or checking out the source code from Github, let
`$GERBIL_HOME` be the top directory of Gerbil.

Then:
```bash
$ cd $GERBIL_HOME/src
$ ./build.sh
```

If you are building in MacOSX and want to use the homebrew OpenSSL,
then you need to specify appropriate `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.
For instance:
```bash
$ LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib \
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include \
  ./build.sh
```
